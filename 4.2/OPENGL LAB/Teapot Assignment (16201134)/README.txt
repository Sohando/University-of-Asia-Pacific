Assalamualikum Mam,

a) Collaboration: I have not collaborated with others as stack overflow helped me to find out the functionality of OPENGL glut.

b) 
    I.  https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/opengl/cg_introduction.html
    II. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDgwkVh4Dpo
    III.https://wrf.ecse.rpi.edu/wiki/ComputerGraphicsFall2013/guha/Code/mouseMotion.cpp
    Iv. https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs248-00/helpsession/opengl/code_example.html

and many other youtube tutorials.

c) One problem is I couldn't understand the additional 2.3(b) task and couldn't implement here. Secondly the mouse inputs are not interactive I mean they will work after I release the buttons.

d) No mam, I went for an straight forward implementation of this project.

e) I had fun but I am confused if I could use GLFW here for mouse/keyboard.

I have programmed in Linux OS and the executable is from here.
Thank You Mam.
